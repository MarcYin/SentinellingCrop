As the Coronavirus pandemic keeps going on, labor shortages and disruptions on supply chains for resources such as fertilisers, pesticides, would increase the risk on food production globally.  We build a crop growth and crop production monitoring system by using time series of multispectral remote sensing data by NASA and ESA, providing accurate and timely information for governments and farmers to make well-informed decisions.
